Abstract:-
Online secondhand book buying and selling portal is the place for students, teachers and for everyone who needs the books. It is a platform that anyone can sell their books or buy the book online. It is the website for all the people but it's is more useful to the students who cannot buy the new books. This web application is designed in such way that it can be used by any person, it is user friendly.

Problem Statement:-
The present system is the manual one hence all the information about the books and their subject wise details maintained in these sites. The second hand books market has not been explored by any one company and market is mostly governed by the small shop vendors. Students donâ€™t have many options with their second hand books and hence we decided to build this project to help all the students as well as another also. Presently, people have limited option with very rare old book stores within a city where they live. This idea will be helpful for all JR and SR, to easily buy and sell the books.

Application:-
Useful for students.
Useful for teachers.
Anyone used to sell or buy the any types of books.
Useful in school libraries and college libraries.

Conclusion:-
There  is no time barriers in selling the product . One can log on the internet even at midnight and can buy product at single click of  mouse. An interactive user friendly and focused website in the form of online shop can generate good business so we are of the opinion that big companies should invest more on research and development for second hand books.
